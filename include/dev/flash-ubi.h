 * @reserved_pebs: how many physical eraseblocks are reserved for this volume
 * @alignment: volume alignment
 * @data_pad: how many bytes are unused at the end of the each physical
 * eraseblock to satisfy the requested alignment
 * @vol_type: volume type (%UBI_DYNAMIC_VOLUME or %UBI_STATIC_VOLUME)
 * @upd_marker: if volume update was started but not finished
 * @name_len: volume name length
 * @name: the volume name
 * @flags: volume flags (%UBI_VTBL_AUTORESIZE_FLG)
 * @padding: reserved, zeroes
 * @crc: a CRC32 checksum of the record
 *
 * The volume table records are stored in the volume table, which is stored in
 * the layout volume. The layout volume consists of 2 logical eraseblock, each
 * of which contains a copy of the volume table (i.e., the volume table is
 * duplicated). The volume table is an array of &struct ubi_vtbl_record
 * objects indexed by the volume ID.
 *
 * If the size of the logical eraseblock is large enough to fit
 * %UBI_MAX_VOLUMES records, the volume table contains %UBI_MAX_VOLUMES
 * records. Otherwise, it contains as many records as it can fit (i.e., size of
 * logical eraseblock divided by sizeof(struct ubi_vtbl_record)).
 *
 * The @upd_marker flag is used to implement volume update. It is set to %1
 * before update and set to %0 after the update. So if the update operation was
 * interrupted, UBI knows that the volume is corrupted.
 *
 * The @alignment field is specified when the volume is created and cannot be
 * later changed. It may be useful, for example, when a block-oriented file
 * system works on top of UBI. The @data_pad field is calculated using the
 * logical eraseblock size and @alignment. The alignment must be multiple to the
 * minimal flash I/O unit. If @alignment is 1, all the available space of
 * the physical eraseblocks is used.
 *
 * Empty records contain all zeroes and the CRC checksum of those zeroes.
